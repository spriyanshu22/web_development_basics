L3: Creating React Projects

• Note that react can be used independently with any frmework but react recommends using VITE(bundler) or other frameworks
• Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

• npm : node package manager (to install the dependencies)
• npm run dev : to run the server
• npx : to run the package without installing it


> npx create-react-app
• to create a react app with the name 
• this commands installs the required dependencies (as node modules) and creates the react app
> npm run start

Howeever, we will use VITE to create the react app as it is faster than create-react-app

> npm create vite@latest . : to create a vite app in the current directory
• however, we will have to install the dependencies using npm i as this command does not install the dependencies
> npm i : 
• to install the dependencies
> npm run dev :
• to run the server

• React Dom : to render the react components (connects react to the DOM)
• React Native : to render the react components on mobile devices 

• For dependencies, veet has only react and react-dom (bare minimum essentials) as dependencies (as it is a build tool) and not the other dependencies that are required for the react app
