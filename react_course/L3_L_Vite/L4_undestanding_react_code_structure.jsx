/*
• React is called single page application (SPA) as it renders the components on the same page without refreshing the page
• Basically jsx picks a tag (say root) and renders (injects) the components inside that tag using DOM
• In react script this is injected by default react scripts in the pachage.json file/ however in vite we have to do it manually by adding the script in the index.html file


• The main page is the index.html file
• The main file is the index.js (in react app)/main.jsx (in vite app) file
• The main file renders the App component and we have also rendered an additional component Youtube in the App component


• Note that in react we could use both js and jsx files but in vite we have to use jsx files only 
• Also in vite functions name should start with capital letter
